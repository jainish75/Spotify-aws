AWS ETL Pipeline - Cost Optimization and Explanation

Overview

This document provides an overview of the AWS ETL pipeline for processing Spotify data and outlines strategies to minimize costs.

Architecture Components

The ETL pipeline consists of the following AWS services:

Amazon S3 (Staging & Data Warehouse) - Used to store raw and processed data.

AWS Glue ETL - Performs data transformation using Glue Jobs.

AWS Glue Crawler - Scans the processed data and creates metadata tables.

Amazon Athena - Allows querying the data using SQL.

Amazon QuickSight - Provides data visualization and reporting.

Workflow Explanation

Data Ingestion: Data is stored in an S3 bucket (Staging).

ETL Processing:

Glue jobs perform transformations (joins, filtering, cleaning) and store processed data in another S3 bucket (Data Warehouse).

A Glue Crawler scans the processed data and updates the AWS Glue Data Catalog.

Querying and Analysis:

Athena is used to execute queries on the Data Catalog.

QuickSight visualizes the results.

Cost Optimization Strategies

To minimize AWS costs, consider the following:

Amazon S3:

Delete unnecessary raw and processed data.

Use S3 Lifecycle Policies to move infrequent data to Glacier.

AWS Glue:

Reduce the number of Glue Job runs or use a lower Data Processing Unit (DPU) configuration.

Use AWS Lambda instead of Glue for lightweight transformations.

Glue Crawler:

Run crawlers on demand instead of on a schedule.

Amazon Athena:

Optimize queries by partitioning and compressing data.

Store data in columnar formats like Parquet to reduce query costs.

Amazon QuickSight:

Use SPICE for caching instead of running frequent queries.

Ensure you use only the necessary number of QuickSight users to avoid extra charges.

Stopping Services to Achieve Zero Cost

If you want to stop the pipeline and reduce costs to zero:

Delete the S3 buckets or move data to Glacier.

Stop all Glue Jobs and delete them if not needed.

Delete Glue Crawlers and their metadata tables.

Disable QuickSight or remove unnecessary dashboards.

Stop using Athena (Athena charges per query execution).

By following these steps, you can significantly reduce or eliminate AWS charges while keeping data available for future use.
