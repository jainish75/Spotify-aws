**🎵 AWS ETL Pipeline for Spotify Data**


**📌 Overview**
This project implements an AWS-based ETL pipeline to process and analyze Spotify data. The pipeline ingests data from Amazon S3, transforms it using AWS Glue, and stores the processed data for querying with Amazon Athena and visualization in Amazon QuickSight.

**🏗️ Architecture**


S3 Staging: Raw Spotify data is stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.

AWS Glue ETL: Extracts, transforms, and loads (ETL) the data.

S3 Data Warehouse: Stores the processed data.

AWS Glue Crawler: Creates a metadata catalog for querying.

Amazon Athena: Enables SQL-based querying on the processed data.

Amazon QuickSight: Provides interactive data visualization and insights.

**💡 ETL Process Steps**

Extract Data: Load data from multiple S3 sources.

Transform Data:

Join Album, Artist, and Track tables.

Drop unnecessary fields.

Load Data: Store the cleaned dataset in an S3 bucket.

Analyze with Athena & Visualize with QuickSight.

**💰 Cost Optimization Tips**

To ensure zero or minimal costs, consider stopping the following services when not in use:

AWS Glue ETL Jobs: Stop scheduled jobs to avoid unnecessary executions.

AWS Glue Crawlers: Disable automatic crawlers if metadata updates are infrequent.

Amazon Athena Queries: Optimize queries to reduce S3 scanning costs.

Amazon QuickSight: Downgrade to the free tier if no active dashboards are needed.

Amazon S3: Use lifecycle policies to delete or archive unused data.

**🚀 How to Run**

Upload raw data to S3 Staging.

Trigger the AWS Glue Job to process the data.

Run the AWS Glue Crawler to update metadata.

Query the data using Amazon Athena.

Visualize insights in Amazon QuickSight.

📌 Future Enhancements

Implement AWS Lambda for event-driven ETL execution.

Optimize Glue jobs using PySpark for better performance.

Automate cost monitoring with AWS Cost Explorer.
